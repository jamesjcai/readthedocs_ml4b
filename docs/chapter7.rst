Classification
==============

A classification problem occurs when an object needs to be assigned into a predefined group or class based on a number of observed attributes related to that object.The individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known as explanatory variables, features, etc. These properties may variously be categorical , ordinal. integer-valued or real-valued.During classification given objects are assigned to prescribed classes. A classifier is a mathematical function,implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category which performs classification.
