What is graph-based learning
============================

An Affinity Matrix, also called a Similarity Matrix, is an essential statistical technique used to organize the mutual similarities between a set of data points. ... These similarity measures can be interpreted as the probability that that two points are related.Representing GraphsThe following sections detail the matrices used to represent the graphs processed in this experiment. The term-document data is represented as a graph G = (V,E), where V = v1, v2, . . . , vn is the vertex set. Each vertex vi represents  a document in the dataset. The edge set E indicates a connection between vertices. In this case, an edge would represent a shared term.-------------
