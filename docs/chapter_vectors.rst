How do you calculate a vector perpendicular to another?

In 3D there are many vectors that are perpendicular to a given vector. Just imagine stem of hair brush to be given vector then each hair of the brush is a vector perpendicular to stem-vector. While there are of course infinite vectors perpendicular to any one 3d vector, here is a simple answer to your question. If your vector is (i,j,k) then one possible orthogonal vector is: (j-k, k-i, -i-j)

In 2D if the given vector is (a,b) then vector perpendicular to it is (-b, a). Their dot product is zero.

In three dimensions, thereâ€™s a special technique: Suppose you start with a vector (x,y,z).

Take another vector (a,b,c) - any vector will do. Now, consider (yc-zb,az-cx,bx-ay). That vector will be perpendicular to (x,y,z) [and also to (a,b,c)] - I leave proving this to you. In order to get a nonzero vector, just choose an (a,b,c) appropriately.

If you start with a 2-d vector (x,y), pretend you have the vector (x,y,0) and let (a,b,c)=(0,0,1). This will give some other vector (f,g,0), which means a perpendicular vector is (f,g). This gives a special formula: a vector perpendicular to (x,y) is (y,-x) [or (-y,x)].

To get a magnitude of 1, just divide any of those vectors by their magnitude.
