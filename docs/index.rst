Machine Learning for Biologists
===============================

Introduction
------------
Data-driven discovery is revolutionizing the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. This textbook brings together machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to integrate modeling and control of dynamical systems with modern methods in data science. It highlights many of the recent advances in scientific computing that enable data-driven methods to be applied to a diverse range of complex systems, such as turbulence, the brain, climate, epidemiology, finance, robotics, and autonomy. Aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in the engineering and physical sciences, the text presents a range of topics and methods from introductory to state of the art.

Machine learning methods are taking a central role in modern bioinformatics and beyond. They can provide an efficient â€¦.. Our goal is to explain machine learning methods and some associated methods as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Beginning with the key definitions, the ______ is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states. We conclude the tutorial with tensor contractions evaluating combinatorial counting problems. The first one counts the number of solutions for Boolean formulae, whereas the second is Penrose's tensor contraction algorithm, returning the number of 3-edge-colorings of 3-regular planar graphs.

Due to the number of gates and the similarities between them, this chapter is at risk of becoming a list. To counter this, we have included a few digressions to introduce important ideas at appropriate places throughout the chapter.

In this book, I provide a self-contained, succinct description of machine learning and of the basic algorithms with a focus on implementation. Since Matlab and Julia are now available as a high-performence computer languages, I present results from simulator and actual experiments for smaller input data sets. The code and implementations
