Using MATLAB to Visualize Scientific Data
=========================================

Introduction
------------
MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in common mathematical notation. MATLAB is an interactive system whose basic data type is the array or matrix.

MATLAB has extensive facilities for displaying vectors and matrices as graphs, as well as annotating and printing these graphs. It includes high-level functions for two-dimensional and three-dimensional data visualization, image processing, animation, and presentation graphics. There are two basic ways to create graphs in MATLAB. You can either use the MATLAB GUI plotting tools to interactively create graphs (see <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/learn_matlab/f3-25097.html">Some Ways to Use Plotting Tools</a> for more information) or you can use the command interface by entering MATLAB graphics commands in the Command Window.

In this tutorial we will use the command interface to show how to visualize scientific data using MATLAB graphics commands. We will cover major visualization techniques such as slicing, color mapping, contouring, oriented glyphs, and streamlines. It is assumed that the student is familiar with the basics of using MATLAB.
