To exploit data for diagnostics, prediction and control, dominant features of the data must be extracted. In the opening chapter of this book, SVD and PCA were introduced as methods for determining the dominant correlated structures contained within a data set. In the eigenfaces example of Sec. 1.6, for instance, the dominant features of a large number of cropped face images were shown. These eigenfaces, which are ordered by their ability to account for commonality (correlation) across the data base of faces was guaranteed to give the best set of r features for reconstructing a given face in an l2 sense with a rank-r truncation. The eigenface modes gave clear and interpretable features for identifying faces, including highlighting the eyes, nose and mouth regions as might be expected. Importantly, instead of working with the high-dimensional measurement space, the feature space allows one to consider a significantly reduced subspace where diagnostics can be performed.
